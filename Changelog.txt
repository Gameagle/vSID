[Changelog v0.14.3]

>[!NOTE]
> Feedback from users with consecutive SID letters welcome to validate proper matching
> e.g. WERRA vs WERA / PAZZE vs PAZE

:new: **New Features**
*	FPLN - temporarily added scratch pad info which callsign used the sync command
*	CONF - collapsing SID or TRANS base when consecutive characters are the same as new Navigraph data collapses those names which are then present in the sector file (#358)
*	FPLN - add squawk queue with a grace period to fetch assignements that were too fast. Squawk assignement works now also in auto-mode and with our own included TopSky assign function (fast click sequence). Note: CCAMS only supported in auto-mode as there currently is no additional function implemented (currently not planned) (#388)

:gear: **Changed Features / Behaviour**
*	GEN - changed topsky and ccams lookup check to lower case
*	FPLN - added checks to _CTL_ and _AUTO_ scratch pad entries to not trigger sync queue processing
*	FPLN - moved clearance flag sync release to flight plan data update
*	FPLN - removed syncing of unset clearance flag - only if the clearance flag is set it will be synced

:lady_beetle: **Fixes**
*	CONF - fixed a crash when SID health check was triggered for different SID numbers due to an accidentally wrong type assignment
*	GEN - moved actual update check to main class (display only caller now) and fixed too many checks (#385)

[Changelog v0.14.2]

:new: **New Features**
*	CONF - transitions without number and designator are now mastered (#338)
*	CONF - SIDs with only a number and no designator are now accepted (#338)
*	GEN - version check added. main config can use config value "notifyUpdate" with a value between 0 and 4. 0 disables notifications, 1 informs about updates via text, 2 via message box, 3 and 4 the same but for pre-releases (default: 1) (#354)
*	GEN - new command ".vsid ghversion" to manually re-check version. If no new version is found there will be no info / output.
*	FPLN - added unsynced cleared to land flag. tag item and tag function both include "(local)" in their name. Does not include any landing warnings. Config value for altitude warning is only used for missed approach calculation (#377)

:lady_beetle: **Fixes**
*	GEN - resetting request queues is now limited to the keyword "reset" (#342)
*	CONF - custom rules in SIDs were not transformed to upper case while rules in the airport were. If the rule was configured in lower case the checks for activation would fail.
*	SID - if an arr rwy could become a dep rwy it wasn't always respected during processing the SIDs for a flight plan

[Changelog v0.14.1]
>[!NOTE]
> This release is only aimed at vACCS that use transitions (SIDxTRANSITION) format
> Other vACCS are welcome to use/test it as SID mastering was updated

:gear: **Changed Features / Behaviour**
*	CONF - improved evaluation for transition mastering to only match transition if the "base" SID also matches (includes checks for correct runways)

:lady_beetle: **Fixes**
*	CONF - fixed wrong assignement of transition number

[Changelog v0.14.0]
>[!IMPORTANT]
>**Main config needs to be updated**
> * new config value "esePath" - see below

>[!TIP]
> new SID config value to allow overwriting of already found SID numbers

:new: **New Features**
*	CONF - new setting "esePath" added to set the path to the .ese file (relative or absolute path - relative recommended). Relative path starts from the folder the vsid.dll is stored in
*	CONF - .ese file is parsed for atc stations as Euroscope sometimes sends sector identifiers as numbers which cannot be matched against airport configs. If ES reports an invalid SI (empty or number) at least 3 times a lookup for a match in the ese atc stations is started. The lookup is stopped after 3 attempts.
*	CONF - with parsed atc stations additional vis points are also stored
*	CONF - .ese file is parsed for SIDs as Euroscope doesn't allow to distinguish between SID and STAR. Only SIDs are now parsed to match against the airport configs (#345)
*	CONF - new config value for SIDs (every level) "allowDiffNumbers". Default setting is **false**. If it is set to true and a SID already has a mastered number the number will be overwritten with the current one if the runway from the ese file is found in the SID configuration (#359)
*	GEN - new command to reload the ese file if needed: .vsid reload ese

:gear: **Changed Features / Behaviour**
*	CONF - runways are now checked during mastering. Before a SID could also be mastered with a different runway than configured (as number and designator are usually the same for different runways it had no negative impact)
*	FPLN - stored additional vis points are used for outOfVis calculation to determine if an aircraft is also out of the vis range of the additional points (controller vis range is used for calculation from vis point to target)

[Changelog v0.13.1]
**Main config needs to be updated!**

**NEW**
*	CONFIG - value "indicatorZoomScale" (current default value: 0.3)

**CHANGED**
*	FPLN - indicator position calculation changed to be resolution independent with only 2 settings (offset in px and zoomScale). zoomScale values: = 0 - constant offset px gap, smaller (positive) values reduce the scaling effect (less extreme), larger (positive) values have a more extreme effect. Negative values flip the effect (further away on zoom out compared to closer on zoom out)
*	DISP - .vsid display config now only shows the zoom level and no diagPx anymore (config value was removed)
*	CONFIG - renamed "indicatorRefOffset" to "indicatorOffset"

**FIXED**
*	FPLN - permanent sync entry present (probably only when using proxy instances - not reproducable without). Turned out usage of an ES internal function caused an issue that resembles a race-condition. Internal ES function was exchanged (#346)

**REMOVED**
*	CONFIG - removed value "indicatorRefDiagPx" and "indicatorRefZoom"

[Changelog v0.13.0]
**NEW**
*	FPLN - the sync command now queues the messages which are sent in sequence one by one after the previous message has been received from the servers (also applies to single scratch pad commands)
*	FPLN - sync messages are no longer added or removed from present scratch pad entries, but the present scratch pad is restored after a sync message has been sent
*	FPLN - sender is now "remover" for any scratch pad commands. So not each client sends its own removal message but the one client that issued the messages also removes it
*	FPLN - added function to call the Topsky Squawk assignement directly (skips the Topsky menu)
*	FPLN - new intersections menu, configurable per airport with two options - a) set the intersection as cleared, b) set the intersection as able. A custom intersection can be entered. Intersections are cut off after 3 characters
	Example in airport config (intersections is a new section like sids or areas):
	```json
	"intersections": {
				"25C": "L1, L3, L6"
			}
	```
	* for pre-configured intersections the scratch pad can be used to set them ("+": set, "-": able; e.g. +L6). The intersection entry needs to be exclusive, so no other entries can be present in the scratch pad
*	FPLN - intersections are shown below the target similar to request and pushback indicators
*	CONF - add health check for SID number mismatches in .sct or .ese files
*	CONF - default reference values for indicators offset calculation added (currently intersection indicator only)
*	CONF - zoom level below which indicators are shown added (currently intersection indicator only)
*	CONF - new config values in main config. Those are "reference" values, so to configure an indicator label from a set default position. Further calculation is based on that default state.
	* indicatorRefOffset - how many pixels the label should be set off the target
	* indicatorRefZoom - the zoom level used for configuring the default state
	* indicatorRefDiagPx - the radar screen diagonal in pixels (can be rounded to 2 decimal places for the config)
	* indicatorShowBelowZoom - below which zoom level the indicator labels are shown
*	GEN - new command ".vsid display config" to show needed reference values for configuration of indicator label positions

**CHANGED**
*	FPLN - Topsky is now the preferred method to issue new squawks while CCAMS is still available
*	FPLN - removed own GRP ground state cleanup
*	FPLN - if a flight plan contains a valid SID/RWY entry (default SID) but the initial climb is set to the requested level another click on "auto" SID sets the IC again (for cases a flight plan reconnects after reconnection time)

**FIXED**
*	FPLN - initial climb wasn't always correctly reset when a flight plan reconnected within reconnection time with new info storage

[Changelog v0.12.2]

**NEW**
*	CONFIG - default values for colors are now set instead of an "error" color for missing config values (#316)
*	REQ - request time is stored for cases a flight plan might reconnect and on a reconnect used to get the request position
*	MENU - optional ICAO parameter added to directly open the startup menu (.vsid menu ZZZZ) (#325)

**CHANGED**
*	REQ - re-sync requests after a flight plan reconnects that has its information still stored
*	GEN - re-sync ground states and clearance flags after a flight plan reconnects that has its information still stored
*	GEN - added additional checks to remove stored information for different flight phases as a cleanup
*	GEN - time for own connection state check is reduced from once a minute to once a second to keep the data always up to date
*	DIS - changed gnd state counting for startup counter (#318)
*	SID	- if only a rwy was selected and sid and customSid were the same customSid is no longer deleted to prevent false evaluation for the item

**FIXED**
*	REQ - possible fix for lacking removal from request lists of disconnected flight plans
*	FPL - possible orphaned remarks after departure are now deleted from the flight plan

[Changelog v0.12.1]

**NEW**
*	SID - new clr item (shows an empty or full square depending on the clearance status) (#277)
*	SID - new function to trigger the SID setting in the flight plan and setting the clearance flag (#277)
*	SID - new function to set the ground state to "startup" in addition to the new clearance function (#277)
*	SID - add "wing type" config option (#305)
*	GEN - error caching added for errors that are subject to euroscope update rates. Errors that might be thrown on controller action are not cached (#296)
*	DIS - new configurable (which screen to display on, color and display enable/disable) pushback indicator - a small arrow left to the radar target when the gnd state is push
*	REQ - new "rwy startup" request list. Requests are switchable between startup and rwy startup. The new list is usable to check the startup position for that specific runway. To see the global position again one can switch back to regular startup. (#145)

**CHANGED**
*	GEN - removed "vSID" from items as it is already written in the dropdown menu (this also mean that in the item type list vSID is not displayed anymore)
*	GEN - renamed item "CLMB" to "Initial Climb"
*	GEN - renamed item "CLR" to "Clearance received flag"
*	GEN - renamed item "CLRF" to "Cleared to land flag"
*	GEN - renamed item "RWY" to "Departure Runway"
*	GEN - renamed item "Trans" to "Departure Transition"
*	GEN - renamed func "SIDs Auto Select" to "Set/Reset suggested SID"
*	GEN - renamed func "Trans Menu" to "Transition menu"
*	GEN - renamed func "RWY menu" to "Runway menu"
*	GEN - renamed func "REQ menu" to "Request menu"
*	GEN - renamed func "CTL" to "Set cleared to land flag"
*	GEN - renamed func "CLR + SID" to "Set CRF and SID"
*	GEN - renamed func "CLR + SID + SU" to "Set CRF, SID and Startup state"
*	GEN - changed / improved flight plan info storing during flight plan updates (attempt for #214)

**FIXED**
*	SID - possible wrong result in SID determination if waypoint doesn't match base and SID is entered in the flight plan (#304)

[Changelog v0.12.0]

**NEW**
*	SID - new SID restriction levels (!! old configs incompatible !!) - levels are "field", "waypoint/base", "designator", "id". Each config option can now be written above each section, e.g. "climbvia" could be written in the line before "waypointXYZ" to be used for all SIDs or it could be written before "B" to be used for all "waypointXYZ" designators. The more nested sections overwrite everything above (so id will overwrite designator and waypoint and field while the waypoint section will overwrite the field section). Aim is to reduce repetition of same config values.

OLD
```json
"ABTAL": {
                    "1": {
                        "designator": "B"
                        "rwy": "25",
                        "initial": 5000
                        "climbvia": true,
                        "prio": 1
                    }
                },
```
NEW
```json
"initial": 5000, # 1 (field level): now valid for the entire field if not overwritten in lower sections
"ABTAL": {
                # 2 (waypoint level): config option here: any config above the first designator is valid for all ABTAL designators
                "B": { # 3: now designator has its own section
                    "climbvia": true, # 4 (designator level): now valid for all IDs of the "B" designator
                    "1": {
                        "rwy": "25", # 5 (ID level): can be used on designator (see # 4 above) or ID level
                        "prio": 1 # 6: (ID level): still has to be on ID level
                    }
                },
```

*	SID - new tagItem "Transition" (Italy support) - retrieves the transition from the flightplan if set or shows the suggested transition based on config values (#233)
*	SID - new config option "trans" to list all possible transitions for a SID as a key/value pair with the key being the waypoint and the value being the designator. Numbers are updated from .ese or .sct files same was with SIDs (#233)
```json
"trans": {"waypoint": "designator", "waypoint2": "designator"}
```
*	SID - new "sidHighlight" and "clmbHighlight" settings for SID and color config (same names apply). As a SID setting those values default to false and can be activated to highlight SID and/or climb values besides the regular colors (#268)
*	SID - designator can now have "dummy" values (numbers) which can be used for SIDs that do not have a designator (e.g. SIDs with only a base). Those values are not saved as designator but used in the config to provide the designator level. Example:
```json
"NG96": {
        "1": { #designator (dummy value)
            "1": { #id
                "wpt": "LNO",
                "rwy": "09",
                "prio": 1
            }
        }
	},
```
*	MENU - non departure rwys are now dynamically added or removed from the startup counter (#260)

**CHANGED**
*	SID - old config option "designator" has now to be moved outside (above levelwise) the ID section as a new key (e.g. "designator": "B" now becomes "B": .. followed by the ID sections for "B")
```json
"waypoint": {
      "A": {
		"1": {},
		"2": {}
		}
	  }
```
*	SID - active departure and arrival runways are now split in allow (aka mandatory) and deny. "all" and "any" remains unchanged (#236)
```json
"actDepRwy": {
	"deny":{"any": "..."},
	"allow":{"all": "..."}
},
"actArrRwy": {
	"deny":{"all": "..."},
	"allow":{"any": "..."}
}
```

**FIXED**
*	MENU - startup counter didn't account for ADEP which could result in wrong counting if two airports with identical rwy numbers where active

**REMOVED**
*	SID - config option "designator"

[Changelog v0.11.1]

[NEW]
*	REQ - added a reset function for the airport (.vsid req ICAO reset) or for single queues (.vsid req ICAO reset startup) (#222)
*	GEN - connection type is checked once a minute. If the connection is disconnected all processed flight plans and those marked for removal are deleted (#261)
*	CTL - cleared to land flag added. The function (VSID CTL) toggles the cleared to land flag. The tag item (VSID CLRF) shows if the acft is cleared or a two step warning if it is close to the airport and not cleared. Value is synced between controllers (#221)
*	CTL - automatic MAPP detection to remove item display (if the acft climbs again MAPP is assumed to remove CTL flag and warnings)
*	CTL - color config options for main config
*	CTL - mandatory section for warning and caution values (distance and altitude) in main config ("clrf") - not providing the section will cause an error but ES and vSID will still work
*	SID - added "enableRVSids" option to airport configuration as bool to enable/disable the generation of radar vectored SIDs in the manual selection menu

[CHANGED]
*	SID - if the RFL is below the initial climb don't show and clear up to the initial climb but show the RFL instead (due to ES limitations color-codes the climb even if not set if RFL is below inital climb). If the SID is clicked (manual or auto selection) the RFL is actively set as cleared altitude for the flight plan (meaning sending the info to the servers)

[FIXED]

*	SID - if a flight plan was amended it was saved that the rwy was set by atc, although there might not be a rwy in the flight plan. Might fix automode not setting SID/IC when areas are active (#241)
*	SID - remarks were not deleted in LFXX package. Turns out with EDXX package scratchpad entries are received in uppercase, which doesn't seem to be the default. Fixed to work in both scenarios (#244)

[Changelog v0.11.0]

[NEW]
*	MENU - menu is now opened with command .vsid menu
*	MENU - left click on a "submenu" opens in the same window (window before is hidden). right click opens in a new window (window before remains)
*	GEN - data exchange between information from ES classes that do not have access to the same information
*	SID - routing restriction option added. Skipping of route parts is possible if a start and an end point should be checked. "allow" route refers to mandatory route and "deny" to forbidden route.

[CHANGED]
*	MENU - extensive rewrite of menu. New menu is self adjusting and self adapting. Startup counter for all active dep rwys for all act apts. More features coming later

[FIXED]
*	SID - RNAV aircraft wouldn't skip NON-RNAV sids if PBN wasn't filled. Now NON-RNAV sids are skipped with presence of G, R or I in the equipment or if PBN isn't empty
*	SID - multiple runways are considered now and checked if active, before the first found runway was chosen although possibly not active (no problem before as only single runway configs present)

[REMOVED]
*	MENU - .vsid startup command removed

[Changelog v0.10.1]

[CHANGED]
*	SID - list to manual select SID changed to show (and set) a rwy with the SID if no dep rwy has been set in the flightplan. If a dep rwy has been set only the SID avbl for that rwy are listed
*	SID - ignoring equipment /T and /U (/L is assumed instead)
*	SID - tagItem display change. EQUIP if the equipment check fails, WAYPOINT (the one which was found) if a manual selection is necessary, MANUAL if no SID could be found (e.g. no valid wpt in the flightplan)
*	RWY - tagItem now displays "---" if a SID has to be manually selected
*	SQWK - squawk assignement together with setting a SID disabled in auto mode - CCAMS stalls with to fast requests
*	GEN - internally stored infos are now removed after fpln is out of vis range (only lateral check possible, checked every 10 seconds). Was fixed at 10 mins before (no time based removal anymore unless invalid/disconnected)

[Changelog v0.10.0]

[NEW]
*	SID - special prio value "0" added in evaluation. This special value forces manual SID selection. This value should only be used in very restrictiv set up SIDs (e.g. with areas or rules).
*	SID - added equipment checks. Special values for "RNAV" and "NON-RNAV" are available or single equipment codes can be set to mandatory or forbidden (each SID defaults to RNAV mandatory)
*	SID - added faa to icao equipment code conversion based on Topsky internal conversion to adapt to a possible error during communication of ES, Topsky and Vatsim servers
*	SID - added destination restriction option. If ADES ICAO is found in the list but is forbidden (false) the SID is skipped. If it is not found in the list but there is at least one mandatory (true) the SID is skipped.
*	SID (item) - special "EQUIP" instead of "MANUAL" display if no SID was found and the last possible check failed due to equipment missmatches
*	Airport - each airport can have equipment checks enabled or disabled in the config (defaults to enabled)
*	Config - new config added with prominent RNAV capable acft due to many wrongly filed flightplans
*	Screen - external functions or in-build (but not accessible) ES functions can now be called by fetching used radar screens (vSID needs to be allowed to draw on the screens)
*	Screen - enabling ground state syncing with .vsid sync
*	Screen - experimental implementation of own menu (for now tied to EDDF during testing)
*	Requests - VFR request added for VFR flights that might be delayed due to traffic. Item is only shown for VFR flightplans

[CHANGED]
*	SID - tagItem - secondary value added. If an airborne acft has no SID set (SID/RWY) missing the first waypoint is displayed instead
*	Debugging - Automatically prefexing debug area before debug message instead of individualizing each messsage
*	Rules - Rules are now only skipped if a rule is active but not the one specified in the SID or if no rule is active at all
*	Route cleaning - additionaly safety if a possibly wrongly filed flightplan would result in an empty route after cleaning. Now the original route is returned with a warning to the controller
*	Route cleaning - callsign was unknown before. Changed to make callsign available.
*	"ATC Block" - callsign was unknown before. Changed to make callsign available. Background work only, but error messages are displayed to controllers

[FIXED]
*	Rule - Rules where always ignored/skipped if a new flightplan came online. Fixed with the changes to the rule system
*	Squawk - Default value 1234 is not displayed anymore
*	SID - custom SID were not reset to default SID if the "auto function" (left click on SID item) was used
*	SID - no error reporting for VFR flightplans if cleaning of the route would result in an empty route - cleaning is now stopped after a possible SID/RWY or ICAO/RWY block

[Changelog v0.9.0]

[NEW]
*	Config - "wpt" entry to specify a waypoint that needs to be matched
*	Config - SIDs are now ID based, which means every SID now has an "id" entry (json key below "base" json key) to distinguish them
	** !! Old configs are not compatible anymore !! **
*	Config - (probably) due to a Euroscope bug SIDs in the .ese file without a route (e.g. MIL SIDs) cannot be accessed. A fallback to .sct file has been added if a SID fails to be mastered
*	"Special" SIDs that are valid for any waypoint (entry "XXX") are now detected and set

[CHANGED]
*	Automode - activation now also ignores flightplans with present rwys (only clearance flag before)
*	Automode - active rules can now be overwritten when selecting a rwy
*	Config - SIDs now have a "base" (the json key) which will become the waypoint if no "wpt" entry was specified
*	Config - SIDs now have a "designator" entry to specify the designator. As SIDs are now ID based several SIDs can use the same designator (no more indexed designators)
*	Evaluation for matching sid and route waypoints now also re-checks if an Euroscope based waypoint was found but doesn't match any in the route
*	If an Euroscope based waypoint is matched with a SID it is only accepted if the waypoint is found in the route (to prevent entire route clearings in case a SID mismatches the route)
*	Manual SID selection now offers all SIDs if no valid waypoint is present in the flightplan if a) rwy is set by atc or b) SID rwy is part of departure rwys
*	SIDs with the "all waypoints" designator ("XXX") are offered in addition to SIDs matching the valid flightplan waypoint
*	Flightplan cleanup now considers routes without a valid SID waypoint - this flightplans are cleared up to the first entry which is not ADEP

[FIXED]
*	Removed unused variables and using direct calls instead
*	Fixed parenthesis warnings

[Changelog v0.8.3]

[CHANGED]
*	further enhanced auto mode to accept inactive rwys (e.g. arr rwys)
*	streamlined debugging messages

[FIXED]
*	forced auto mode only worked for new flightplans coming online - now the flightplans are reset correctly

[Changelog v0.8.2]

[FIXED]
*	requests were reset when setting a squawk without deletion in the request list
	resulting in wrong numbered requests (e.g. request no. 2 although only 1 request was present)
*	auto and manual SID selection now respect the rwy set by atc so the "default" rwy is no longer overwriting
	atc decision
*	very rare access violation caused by additional whitespaces at specific positions in a flightplan
	(by wrong flightplans or controller error during edits)
*	requests were not saved when updating active airports or runways or when using airport settings like rules

[CHANGED]
*	reverted copy parameters back to reference parameters
*	added additional checks for flightplan invalidity past the initial check for the case a flightplan becomes
	invalid after the first check was passed

[Changelog v0.8.1a - HOTFIX]

[FIXED]
*	selecting a custom rwy that is not part of the active rwys resulted in SID displayed as RWY

[Changelog v0.8.1]

[NEW]
*	synced requests with timer

[Changelog v0.8.0]

[NEW]
*	Areas configurable with lat / lon coordinates from ES
*	auto mode now works also for app/ctr with lower controller detection and app/ctr priorities in settings
*	tagItem Squawk (needs to be combined with a function, e.g. CCAMS) - text only
*	active RWY - SIDs can be configured to need the specified RWY as active to be considered
*	debugging "areas" to be able to select only specific debug messages

[CHANGED]
*	Settings save format as settings have increased
*	detection of active airports to not use runways
*	allow automode force only if at least one lower controller is online
*	automode - up to TWR only the own airport can be set in automode
*	automode - APP can only set own airport and where mentioned in appSI
*	automode - CTR can only set where mentioned in appSI
*	default timezone for airport configs is now "Etc/UTC"
*	arrAsDep for rwys is now per area and not per airport

[FIXED]

*	FP cleaning removed entire route for filed speed-level group with SID waypoint
*	tagItem SID was flashing for "VFR" and "NO SID"
*	tagItem SID was slow in showing the text for "VFR" and "NO SID" (has to be monitored)
*	automode now changes SID when rwy at airport changes
*	Crash if unconfigured airport was selected

[Changelog v0.7.2]

[CHANGED]
*	if a reconnected fpln misses the atc block it is reprocessed if automode on
*	if a flightplan changes it retriggers the automode

[FIXED]
*	Automode edits fpln when reloading config
*	Retrigger automode after fpln changes
*	If reconnected fpln misses atc block retrigger automode
*	active custom rule resulted in red SID coloring
*	if only ICAO/RWY is in fpln a custom SID did not show initial climb as correct but as custom
*	initial climb is missing if the assigned SID is not the suggested SID (and not custom based on rwy)
*	pilotfiled "true" overruled restrictions on SIDs


[Changelog v0.7.1]

[Fixed]
*	Missmatch between sugested SID and rwy tagItem if ICAO/RWY is present

*	Remarks are set if vSID sets an ICAO/RWY block
	~ if the block is later SID/RWY the remark is removed

[CHANGED]
*	C++ Version upgraded from 17 to 20
*	RWY tagItem color coding improved
	~ based on different alternating factors (isamended, iscleared, has vsid remark, is SID/RWY)
*	Flightplans are only processed if ADEP is an active apt and GS <= 50 knots

[FIXED]
*	If a manual rwy was selected autoselection reverted to the default RWY instead of keeping the selected

[Changelog v0.5.0]
[NEW]
*	VFR flightplans are now processed but handled differently from IFR flightplans
