[Changelog v0.10.1]

[CHANGED]
*	SID - list to manual select SID changed to show (and set) a rwy with the SID if no dep rwy has been set in the flightplan. If a dep rwy has been set only the SID avbl for that rwy are listed
*	SID - ignoring equipment /T and /U (/L is assumed instead)
*	SID - tagItem display change. EQUIP if the equipment check fails, WAYPOINT (the one which was found) if a manual selection is necessary, MANUAL if no SID could be found (e.g. no valid wpt in the flightplan)
*	RWY - tagItem now displays "---" if a SID has to be manually selected
*	SQWK - squawk assignement together with setting a SID disabled in auto mode - CCAMS stalls with to fast requests
*	GEN - internally stored infos are now removed after fpln is out of vis range (only lateral check possible, checked every 10 seconds). Was fixed after 10 mins before (no time based removal anymore)

[Changelog v0.10.0]

[NEW]
*	SID - special prio value "0" added in evaluation. This special value forces manual SID selection. This value should only be used in very restrictiv set up SIDs (e.g. with areas or rules).
*	SID - added equipment checks. Special values for "RNAV" and "NON-RNAV" are available or single equipment codes can be set to mandatory or forbidden (each SID defaults to RNAV mandatory)
*	SID - added faa to icao equipment code conversion based on Topsky internal conversion to adapt to a possible error during communication of ES, Topsky and Vatsim servers
*	SID - added destination restriction option. If ADES ICAO is found in the list but is forbidden (false) the SID is skipped. If it is not found in the list but there is at least one mandatory (true) the SID is skipped.
*	SID (item) - special "EQUIP" instead of "MANUAL" display if no SID was found and the last possible check failed due to equipment missmatches
*	Airport - each airport can have equipment checks enabled or disabled in the config (defaults to enabled)
*	Config - new config added with prominent RNAV capable acft due to many wrongly filed flightplans
*	Screen - external functions or in-build (but not accessible) ES functions can now be called by fetching used radar screens (vSID needs to be allowed to draw on the screens)
*	Screen - enabling ground state syncing with .vsid sync
*	Screen - experimental implementation of own menu (for now tied to EDDF during testing)
*	Requests - VFR request added for VFR flights that might be delayed due to traffic. Item is only shown for VFR flightplans

[CHANGED]
*	SID - tagItem - secondary value added. If an airborne acft has no SID set (SID/RWY) missing the first waypoint is displayed instead
*	Debugging - Automatically prefexing debug area before debug message instead of individualizing each messsage
*	Rules - Rules are now only skipped if a rule is active but not the one specified in the SID or if no rule is active at all
*	Route cleaning - additionaly safety if a possibly wrongly filed flightplan would result in an empty route after cleaning. Now the original route is returned with a warning to the controller
*	Route cleaning - callsign was unknown before. Changed to make callsign available.
*	"ATC Block" - callsign was unknown before. Changed to make callsign available. Background work only, but error messages are displayed to controllers

[FIXED]
*	Rule - Rules where always ignored/skipped if a new flightplan came online. Fixed with the changes to the rule system
*	Squawk - Default value 1234 is not displayed anymore
*	SID - custom SID were not reset to default SID if the "auto function" (left click on SID item) was used
*	SID - no error reporting for VFR flightplans if cleaning of the route would result in an empty route - cleaning is now stopped after a possible SID/RWY or ICAO/RWY block

[Changelog v0.9.0]

[NEW]
*	Config - "wpt" entry to specify a waypoint that needs to be matched
*	Config - SIDs are now ID based, which means every SID now has an "id" entry (json key below "base" json key) to distinguish them
	** !! Old configs are not compatible anymore !! **
*	Config - (probably) due to a Euroscope bug SIDs in the .ese file without a route (e.g. MIL SIDs) cannot be accessed. A fallback to .sct file has been added if a SID fails to be mastered
*	"Special" SIDs that are valid for any waypoint (entry "XXX") are now detected and set

[CHANGED]
*	Automode - activation now also ignores flightplans with present rwys (only clearance flag before)
*	Automode - active rules can now be overwritten when selecting a rwy
*	Config - SIDs now have a "base" (the json key) which will become the waypoint if no "wpt" entry was specified
*	Config - SIDs now have a "designator" entry to specify the designator. As SIDs are now ID based several SIDs can use the same designator (no more indexed designators)
*	Evaluation for matching sid and route waypoints now also re-checks if an Euroscope based waypoint was found but doesn't match any in the route
*	If an Euroscope based waypoint is matched with a SID it is only accepted if the waypoint is found in the route (to prevent entire route clearings in case a SID mismatches the route)
*	Manual SID selection now offers all SIDs if no valid waypoint is present in the flightplan if a) rwy is set by atc or b) SID rwy is part of departure rwys
*	SIDs with the "all waypoints" designator ("XXX") are offered in addition to SIDs matching the valid flightplan waypoint
*	Flightplan cleanup now considers routes without a valid SID waypoint - this flightplans are cleared up to the first entry which is not ADEP

[FIXED]
*	Removed unused variables and using direct calls instead
*	Fixed parenthesis warnings

[Changelog v0.8.3]

[CHANGED]
*	further enhanced auto mode to accept inactive rwys (e.g. arr rwys)
*	streamlined debugging messages

[FIXED]
*	forced auto mode only worked for new flightplans coming online - now the flightplans are reset correctly

[Changelog v0.8.2]

[FIXED]
*	requests were reset when setting a squawk without deletion in the request list
	resulting in wrong numbered requests (e.g. request no. 2 although only 1 request was present)
*	auto and manual SID selection now respect the rwy set by atc so the "default" rwy is no longer overwriting
	atc decision
*	very rare access violation caused by additional whitespaces at specific positions in a flightplan
	(by wrong flightplans or controller error during edits)
*	requests were not saved when updating active airports or runways or when using airport settings like rules

[CHANGED]
*	reverted copy parameters back to reference parameters
*	added additional checks for flightplan invalidity past the initial check for the case a flightplan becomes
	invalid after the first check was passed

*	FP cleaning removed entire route for filed speed-level group with SID waypoint
*	tagItem SID was flashing for "VFR" and "NO SID"
*	tagItem SID was slow in showing the text for "VFR" and "NO SID" (has to be monitored)
*	automode now changes SID when rwy at airport changes
*	Crash if unconfigured airport was selected
