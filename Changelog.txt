[Changelog v0.12.1]

**NEW**
*	CONFIG - default values for colors are now set instead of an "error" color for missing config values

**CHANGED**
*	REQ - re-sync requests after a flight plan reconnects that has its information still stored
*	GEN - re-sync ground states and clearance flags after a flight plan reconnects that has its information still stored (might fix #318)

**FIXED**
*	REQ - possible fix for lacking removal from request lists of disconnected flight plans

[Changelog v0.12.1]

**NEW**
*	SID - new clr item (shows an empty or full square depending on the clearance status) (#277)
*	SID - new function to trigger the SID setting in the flight plan and setting the clearance flag (#277)
*	SID - new function to set the ground state to "startup" in addition to the new clearance function (#277)
*	SID - add "wing type" config option (#305)
*	GEN - error caching added for errors that are subject to euroscope update rates. Errors that might be thrown on controller action are not cached (#296)
*	DIS - new configurable (which screen to display on, color and display enable/disable) pushback indicator - a small arrow left to the radar target when the gnd state is push
*	REQ - new "rwy startup" request list. Requests are switchable between startup and rwy startup. The new list is usable to check the startup position for that specific runway. To see the global position again one can switch back to regular startup. (#145)

**CHANGED**
*	GEN - removed "vSID" from items as it is already written in the dropdown menu (this also mean that in the item type list vSID is not displayed anymore)
*	GEN - renamed item "CLMB" to "Initial Climb"
*	GEN - renamed item "CLR" to "Clearance received flag"
*	GEN - renamed item "CLRF" to "Cleared to land flag"
*	GEN - renamed item "RWY" to "Departure Runway"
*	GEN - renamed item "Trans" to "Departure Transition"
*	GEN - renamed func "SIDs Auto Select" to "Set/Reset suggested SID"
*	GEN - renamed func "Trans Menu" to "Transition menu"
*	GEN - renamed func "RWY menu" to "Runway menu"
*	GEN - renamed func "REQ menu" to "Request menu"
*	GEN - renamed func "CTL" to "Set cleared to land flag"
*	GEN - renamed func "CLR + SID" to "Set CRF and SID"
*	GEN - renamed func "CLR + SID + SU" to "Set CRF, SID and Startup state"
*	GEN - changed / improved flight plan info storing during flight plan updates (attempt for #214)

**FIXED**
*	SID - possible wrong result in SID determination if waypoint doesn't match base and SID is entered in the flight plan (#304)

[Changelog v0.12.0]

**NEW**
*	SID - new SID restriction levels (!! old configs incompatible !!) - levels are "field", "waypoint/base", "designator", "id". Each config option can now be written above each section, e.g. "climbvia" could be written in the line before "waypointXYZ" to be used for all SIDs or it could be written before "B" to be used for all "waypointXYZ" designators. The more nested sections overwrite everything above (so id will overwrite designator and waypoint and field while the waypoint section will overwrite the field section). Aim is to reduce repetition of same config values.

OLD
```json
"ABTAL": {
                    "1": {
                        "designator": "B"
                        "rwy": "25",
                        "initial": 5000
                        "climbvia": true,
                        "prio": 1
                    }
                },
```
NEW
```json
"initial": 5000, # 1 (field level): now valid for the entire field if not overwritten in lower sections
"ABTAL": {
                # 2 (waypoint level): config option here: any config above the first designator is valid for all ABTAL designators
                "B": { # 3: now designator has its own section
                    "climbvia": true, # 4 (designator level): now valid for all IDs of the "B" designator
                    "1": {
                        "rwy": "25", # 5 (ID level): can be used on designator (see # 4 above) or ID level
                        "prio": 1 # 6: (ID level): still has to be on ID level
                    }
                },
```

*	SID - new tagItem "Transition" (Italy support) - retrieves the transition from the flightplan if set or shows the suggested transition based on config values (#233)
*	SID - new config option "trans" to list all possible transitions for a SID as a key/value pair with the key being the waypoint and the value being the designator. Numbers are updated from .ese or .sct files same was with SIDs (#233)
```json
"trans": {"waypoint": "designator", "waypoint2": "designator"}
```
*	SID - new "sidHighlight" and "clmbHighlight" settings for SID and color config (same names apply). As a SID setting those values default to false and can be activated to highlight SID and/or climb values besides the regular colors (#268)
*	SID - designator can now have "dummy" values (numbers) which can be used for SIDs that do not have a designator (e.g. SIDs with only a base). Those values are not saved as designator but used in the config to provide the designator level. Example:
```json
"NG96": {
        "1": { #designator (dummy value)
            "1": { #id
                "wpt": "LNO",
                "rwy": "09",
                "prio": 1
            }
        }
	},
```
*	MENU - non departure rwys are now dynamically added or removed from the startup counter (#260)

**CHANGED**
*	SID - old config option "designator" has now to be moved outside (above levelwise) the ID section as a new key (e.g. "designator": "B" now becomes "B": .. followed by the ID sections for "B")
```json
"waypoint": {
      "A": {
		"1": {},
		"2": {}
		}
	  }
```
*	SID - active departure and arrival runways are now split in allow (aka mandatory) and deny. "all" and "any" remains unchanged (#236)
```json
"actDepRwy": {
	"deny":{"any": "..."},
	"allow":{"all": "..."}
},
"actArrRwy": {
	"deny":{"all": "..."},
	"allow":{"any": "..."}
}
```

**FIXED**
*	MENU - startup counter didn't account for ADEP which could result in wrong counting if two airports with identical rwy numbers where active

**REMOVED**
*	SID - config option "designator"

[Changelog v0.11.1]

[NEW]
*	REQ - added a reset function for the airport (.vsid req ICAO reset) or for single queues (.vsid req ICAO reset startup) (#222)
*	GEN - connection type is checked once a minute. If the connection is disconnected all processed flight plans and those marked for removal are deleted (#261)
*	CTL - cleared to land flag added. The function (VSID CTL) toggles the cleared to land flag. The tag item (VSID CLRF) shows if the acft is cleared or a two step warning if it is close to the airport and not cleared. Value is synced between controllers (#221)
*	CTL - automatic MAPP detection to remove item display (if the acft climbs again MAPP is assumed to remove CTL flag and warnings)
*	CTL - color config options for main config
*	CTL - mandatory section for warning and caution values (distance and altitude) in main config ("clrf") - not providing the section will cause an error but ES and vSID will still work
*	SID - added "enableRVSids" option to airport configuration as bool to enable/disable the generation of radar vectored SIDs in the manual selection menu

[CHANGED]
*	SID - if the RFL is below the initial climb don't show and clear up to the initial climb but show the RFL instead (due to ES limitations color-codes the climb even if not set if RFL is below inital climb). If the SID is clicked (manual or auto selection) the RFL is actively set as cleared altitude for the flight plan (meaning sending the info to the servers)

[FIXED]

*	SID - if a flight plan was amended it was saved that the rwy was set by atc, although there might not be a rwy in the flight plan. Might fix automode not setting SID/IC when areas are active (#241)
*	SID - remarks were not deleted in LFXX package. Turns out with EDXX package scratchpad entries are received in uppercase, which doesn't seem to be the default. Fixed to work in both scenarios (#244)

[Changelog v0.11.0]

[NEW]
*	MENU - menu is now opened with command .vsid menu
*	MENU - left click on a "submenu" opens in the same window (window before is hidden). right click opens in a new window (window before remains)
*	GEN - data exchange between information from ES classes that do not have access to the same information
*	SID - routing restriction option added. Skipping of route parts is possible if a start and an end point should be checked. "allow" route refers to mandatory route and "deny" to forbidden route.

[CHANGED]
*	MENU - extensive rewrite of menu. New menu is self adjusting and self adapting. Startup counter for all active dep rwys for all act apts. More features coming later

[FIXED]
*	SID - RNAV aircraft wouldn't skip NON-RNAV sids if PBN wasn't filled. Now NON-RNAV sids are skipped with presence of G, R or I in the equipment or if PBN isn't empty
*	SID - multiple runways are considered now and checked if active, before the first found runway was chosen although possibly not active (no problem before as only single runway configs present)

[REMOVED]
*	MENU - .vsid startup command removed

[Changelog v0.10.1]

[CHANGED]
*	SID - list to manual select SID changed to show (and set) a rwy with the SID if no dep rwy has been set in the flightplan. If a dep rwy has been set only the SID avbl for that rwy are listed
*	SID - ignoring equipment /T and /U (/L is assumed instead)
*	SID - tagItem display change. EQUIP if the equipment check fails, WAYPOINT (the one which was found) if a manual selection is necessary, MANUAL if no SID could be found (e.g. no valid wpt in the flightplan)
*	RWY - tagItem now displays "---" if a SID has to be manually selected
*	SQWK - squawk assignement together with setting a SID disabled in auto mode - CCAMS stalls with to fast requests
*	GEN - internally stored infos are now removed after fpln is out of vis range (only lateral check possible, checked every 10 seconds). Was fixed at 10 mins before (no time based removal anymore unless invalid/disconnected)

[Changelog v0.10.0]

[NEW]
*	SID - special prio value "0" added in evaluation. This special value forces manual SID selection. This value should only be used in very restrictiv set up SIDs (e.g. with areas or rules).
*	SID - added equipment checks. Special values for "RNAV" and "NON-RNAV" are available or single equipment codes can be set to mandatory or forbidden (each SID defaults to RNAV mandatory)
*	SID - added faa to icao equipment code conversion based on Topsky internal conversion to adapt to a possible error during communication of ES, Topsky and Vatsim servers
*	SID - added destination restriction option. If ADES ICAO is found in the list but is forbidden (false) the SID is skipped. If it is not found in the list but there is at least one mandatory (true) the SID is skipped.
*	SID (item) - special "EQUIP" instead of "MANUAL" display if no SID was found and the last possible check failed due to equipment missmatches
*	Airport - each airport can have equipment checks enabled or disabled in the config (defaults to enabled)
*	Config - new config added with prominent RNAV capable acft due to many wrongly filed flightplans
*	Screen - external functions or in-build (but not accessible) ES functions can now be called by fetching used radar screens (vSID needs to be allowed to draw on the screens)
*	Screen - enabling ground state syncing with .vsid sync
*	Screen - experimental implementation of own menu (for now tied to EDDF during testing)
*	Requests - VFR request added for VFR flights that might be delayed due to traffic. Item is only shown for VFR flightplans

[CHANGED]
*	SID - tagItem - secondary value added. If an airborne acft has no SID set (SID/RWY) missing the first waypoint is displayed instead
*	Debugging - Automatically prefexing debug area before debug message instead of individualizing each messsage
*	Rules - Rules are now only skipped if a rule is active but not the one specified in the SID or if no rule is active at all
*	Route cleaning - additionaly safety if a possibly wrongly filed flightplan would result in an empty route after cleaning. Now the original route is returned with a warning to the controller
*	Route cleaning - callsign was unknown before. Changed to make callsign available.
*	"ATC Block" - callsign was unknown before. Changed to make callsign available. Background work only, but error messages are displayed to controllers

[FIXED]
*	Rule - Rules where always ignored/skipped if a new flightplan came online. Fixed with the changes to the rule system
*	Squawk - Default value 1234 is not displayed anymore
*	SID - custom SID were not reset to default SID if the "auto function" (left click on SID item) was used
*	SID - no error reporting for VFR flightplans if cleaning of the route would result in an empty route - cleaning is now stopped after a possible SID/RWY or ICAO/RWY block

[Changelog v0.9.0]

[NEW]
*	Config - "wpt" entry to specify a waypoint that needs to be matched
*	Config - SIDs are now ID based, which means every SID now has an "id" entry (json key below "base" json key) to distinguish them
	** !! Old configs are not compatible anymore !! **
*	Config - (probably) due to a Euroscope bug SIDs in the .ese file without a route (e.g. MIL SIDs) cannot be accessed. A fallback to .sct file has been added if a SID fails to be mastered
*	"Special" SIDs that are valid for any waypoint (entry "XXX") are now detected and set

[CHANGED]
*	Automode - activation now also ignores flightplans with present rwys (only clearance flag before)
*	Automode - active rules can now be overwritten when selecting a rwy
*	Config - SIDs now have a "base" (the json key) which will become the waypoint if no "wpt" entry was specified
*	Config - SIDs now have a "designator" entry to specify the designator. As SIDs are now ID based several SIDs can use the same designator (no more indexed designators)
*	Evaluation for matching sid and route waypoints now also re-checks if an Euroscope based waypoint was found but doesn't match any in the route
*	If an Euroscope based waypoint is matched with a SID it is only accepted if the waypoint is found in the route (to prevent entire route clearings in case a SID mismatches the route)
*	Manual SID selection now offers all SIDs if no valid waypoint is present in the flightplan if a) rwy is set by atc or b) SID rwy is part of departure rwys
*	SIDs with the "all waypoints" designator ("XXX") are offered in addition to SIDs matching the valid flightplan waypoint
*	Flightplan cleanup now considers routes without a valid SID waypoint - this flightplans are cleared up to the first entry which is not ADEP

[FIXED]
*	Removed unused variables and using direct calls instead
*	Fixed parenthesis warnings

[Changelog v0.8.3]

[CHANGED]
*	further enhanced auto mode to accept inactive rwys (e.g. arr rwys)
*	streamlined debugging messages

[FIXED]
*	forced auto mode only worked for new flightplans coming online - now the flightplans are reset correctly

[Changelog v0.8.2]

[FIXED]
*	requests were reset when setting a squawk without deletion in the request list
	resulting in wrong numbered requests (e.g. request no. 2 although only 1 request was present)
*	auto and manual SID selection now respect the rwy set by atc so the "default" rwy is no longer overwriting
	atc decision
*	very rare access violation caused by additional whitespaces at specific positions in a flightplan
	(by wrong flightplans or controller error during edits)
*	requests were not saved when updating active airports or runways or when using airport settings like rules

[CHANGED]
*	reverted copy parameters back to reference parameters
*	added additional checks for flightplan invalidity past the initial check for the case a flightplan becomes
	invalid after the first check was passed

[Changelog v0.8.1a - HOTFIX]

[FIXED]
*	selecting a custom rwy that is not part of the active rwys resulted in SID displayed as RWY

[NEW]
*	Areas configurable with lat / lon coordinates from ES
*	auto mode now works also for app/ctr with lower controller detection and app/ctr priorities in settings

[CHANGED]
*	Settings save format as settings have increased
*	detection of active airports to not use runways
*	allow automode force only if at least one lower controller is online

*	automode - CTR can only set where mentioned in appSI
*	default timezone for airport configs is now "Etc/UTC"
*	arrAsDep for rwys is now per area and not per airport

[FIXED]

*	FP cleaning removed entire route for filed speed-level group with SID waypoint
*	tagItem SID was flashing for "VFR" and "NO SID"
*	tagItem SID was slow in showing the text for "VFR" and "NO SID" (has to be monitored)
*	automode now changes SID when rwy at airport changes
*	Crash if unconfigured airport was selected

[Changelog v0.7.2]

[CHANGED]
*	if a reconnected fpln misses the atc block it is reprocessed if automode on
*	if a flightplan changes it retriggers the automode

[FIXED]
*	Automode edits fpln when reloading config
*	Retrigger automode after fpln changes
*	If reconnected fpln misses atc block retrigger automode
*	active custom rule resulted in red SID coloring
*	if only ICAO/RWY is in fpln a custom SID did not show initial climb as correct but as custom
